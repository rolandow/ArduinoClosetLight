# ArduinoClosetLight
Small Arduino project that turns on a light when a door is opened in my closet

This project basically has two sensors and a LED strip. If one sensor is being activated, half of the led strip will turn on. If the other sensor is activated, the other half will turn on. There is also an auto turn-off.

This is my first real world Arduino project :-)
